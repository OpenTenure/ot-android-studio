    <string name="showcase_main_message">\n \n 
        									\n Open Tenure is an open source software app, developed by UN-FAO, for the in-the-field recording of property rights.
											\n The boundaries of a property can be mapped and property and ownership details can be captured as well as images of
                                            \n supporting documents and photos of the property.
											\n Open Tenure is used with a web based community server (such as SOLA Community Server) where existing property details
                                            \n and map imagery can be downloaded before field capture and new details can be uploaded after field capture.
