Open Tenure Privacy Policy

The privacy policy behind Open Tenure reflects the privacy policy of the Open Tenure Community you join.

Open Tenure is a client application allowing to record land tenure rights related claims to be shared among a community for informal rights recognition.
Open Tenure stores personal information (name, address, date of birth and more) about the claimant and other people mentioned in the claim, and has access to your device camera, local files and position, to add to the claim snapshots of the location and previously mentioned people, property related documents, spatial data about property boundary and location, as well as anything that could help the community in evaluating the rights claim properly.
It also uses your device network connection to upload claims to a Community owned server as well as to download claims uploaded on the same server by other claimants.
No commercial service or organization has access to the information you collect using Open Tenure but, in order to upload, download and share information, you must join a community and the members of this community will have access to all the information you upload to your Community Server.
All the collected information will stay on your device until you explicitly decide to upload it on your Community server, or transfer it via other means (transfer and/or print files, send as email attachments).
Collected information, with the exception of document files, can be encrypted on your device and all information exchanged with the Community server is encrypted as lon as you configure the server for using https.
The amount and type of personal information requested by the client may change in time and varies across communities since a Community Server can be configured to instruct Open Tenure to request more and/or different information.
All the information stays within the community, but community members have the possibility to export information to third party so, when you join a community, you implicitly trust all present and future members of that community about keeping shared information private.
